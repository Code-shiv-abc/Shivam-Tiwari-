          I am a passionate software engineer dedicated to building robust and scalable web applications.
          My journey started with a curiosity for how things work on the internet, which evolved into a career
          bridging the gap between complex backend logic and intuitive frontend experiences.

          Recently, I have been exploring the intersection of traditional web development and Generative AI.
          I believe that AI is not just a tool but a paradigm shift in how we interact with information.
          My goal is to create digital experiences that are not only performant but also intelligent and adaptive.

          When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m likely reading about the latest in AI, contributing to open source,
          or exploring the outdoors.
